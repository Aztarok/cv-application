# CV Application

# What I learned

In this cv application I learned more about React and how it functions with the
DOM and Virtual DOM. I got better at the useState and useEffect hooks, and tried
out prop drilling. This was a fun process of trying out new things and figuring
out how to make the page editable and downloadable.
